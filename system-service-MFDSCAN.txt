To run your `Monitor-ServiceAccount-Lockout.ps1` script as the **SYSTEM user** on the remote server `HQ3dcvip04` and have it monitor that server’s event logs, follow these steps:

---

## 1. **Place the Script on HQ3dcvip04**
- Copy your script to a location on `HQ3dcvip04` (e.g., `C:\Scripts\Monitor-ServiceAccount-Lockout.ps1`).

---

## 2. **Edit the Script to Query the Remote Event Log (if running elsewhere)**
If you run the script **from another machine but want to check HQ3dcvip04**'s logs, add the `-ComputerName` parameter to `Get-WinEvent`:

```powershell
$TargetComputer = "HQ3dcvip04"

$events = Get-WinEvent -ComputerName $TargetComputer -FilterHashtable @{
    LogName = 'Security'
    Id = 4740
    StartTime = (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-5)
} | Where-Object { $_.Properties[0].Value -eq $ServiceAccount }
```
If the script is running **directly on HQ3dcvip04**, you do not need `-ComputerName`.

## 3. **Create a Scheduled Task as SYSTEM**
To run the script as SYSTEM, use Task Scheduler on `HQ3dcvip04`:

### **A. Open Task Scheduler as Administrator**
- On HQ3dcvip04: Start > type `Task Scheduler` > right-click > Run as administrator

### **B. Create a New Task**
- **Action**: “Create Task…” (not “Create Basic Task”)
- **General Tab**:
  - Name: `Monitor-ServiceAccount-Lockout`
  - **Security Options**:  
    - **Run whether user is logged on or not**
    - **Run with highest privileges**
    - **User or Group**: Click “Change User or Group…” > type `SYSTEM` > Check Names > OK
- **Triggers Tab**:
  - New… > Begin the task: On a schedule
  - Set to repeat every 5 minutes indefinitely
- **Actions Tab**:
  - New… > Action: Start a program
  - Program/script: `powershell.exe`
  - Add arguments: `-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Scripts\Monitor-ServiceAccount-Lockout.ps1"`
- **Conditions/Settings**: As needed for your environment

### **C. Save the Task**
- Click OK, enter admin credentials if prompted.

## 4. **Permissions & Firewall**
- SYSTEM will have access to local event logs.
- If you intend to run this script **remotely** and query event logs on HQ3dcvip04, ensure:
  - You have firewall rules to allow remote event log access.
  - The account running the script has necessary DCOM and event log reader permissions on HQ3dcvip04.

---

## 5. **Test the Task**
- Right-click the task > Run.
- Check your log file (`C:\logfiles\MFDSCAN-Monitor.log`) for debug output.

---

## **Summary**
- **Best practice:** Place and run the script *locally* on HQ3dcvip04 as SYSTEM using Task Scheduler for event log access.
- **To monitor other servers remotely**, adjust `Get-WinEvent` with `-ComputerName` and ensure permissions.
- **No script changes needed** if running on HQ3dcvip04 as SYSTEM and monitoring local logs.
